# Progress: LOOKYM

> **This file tracks progress history and current state for onboarding and context.**

## What Works

- **Project Setup:** React Native/Expo project initialized with TypeScript.
- **Directory Structure:** Established project layout.
- **Navigation:** Basic navigation setup with Expo Router.
- **State Management:** Zustand configured with persistence.
- **Authentication:**
  - Supabase Auth integration complete.
  - Login/Registration screens functional.
  - User/Business role distinction implemented.
  - Session persistence using AsyncStorage.
  - Protected routes based on authentication state.
- **Basic Chat UI:** Chat list and conversation screens exist.
- **Supabase Database:**
  - Schema (`sql/schema.sql`) successfully applied to the Supabase project.
  - Tables, functions, views, triggers, and RLS policies created.
  - Schema reviewed against project docs and confirmed to be aligned and comprehensive.
  - `handle_new_user` trigger successfully verified: correctly creates profiles in `public.users` upon signup when client passes required metadata (`username`, `role`).
- **Video Upload (Partial):**
  - Cloudinary setup complete.
  - Video selection from gallery implemented (`expo-image-picker`).
  - Video preview implemented (`expo-video`).
  - UI for caption/hashtags added.
  - Successful upload to Cloudinary from client-side implemented.
  - Layout issues resolved.

## What's Left to Build (Core - Phase 2)

- **Video System:**
  - Video Upload:
    - **Integrate Supabase save:** Store video metadata (URL, caption, etc.) in `public.videos` table after Cloudinary upload.
    - Implement video recording (`expo-camera`).
    - Add progress tracking for upload.
  - Video Player component.
  - Video Feed display.
  - Video Interactions (Likes, Comments, Saves - backend functions exist, frontend needed).
  - Video Detail Screen.
- **Chat System:**
  - Ensure full real-time functionality.
  - Implement unread indicators.
  - Refine UI/UX.
- **User/Business Profiles:**
  - Profile Screen UI.
  - Profile Editing functionality.
  - Display user/business specific content (videos, saves).
  - Verification badges.

## Current Status

- In Phase 2 of the development plan: Core Features Implementation.
- Supabase database setup verified (schema applied, profile trigger working).
- **Next:** Complete Video Upload feature by implementing Supabase integration.

## Known Issues/TODOs (High Priority from `docs/3TODO.txt`)

- Bundling error with `react-native-url-polyfill`.
- **Complete video upload (Supabase integration remaining).**
- Implement video feed & playback controls.
- Create video detail screen with comments.
- Implement profile screen & editing.
- Add search functionality.
- Ensure proper error handling in authentication.
- Fix video playback issues on web.
- Address chat message ordering.
