# Project LOOKYM: Analysis and Action Plan (2024-05-23)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a summary of the LOOKYM project analysis conducted in May 2024. It includes key findings, recommendations for improvement across Product Management, UI/UX, and Development, and a proposed action plan to guide future development efforts. The goal is to offer a practical and actionable roadmap for enhancing the LOOKYM application.

## 2. Overall Project Analysis Summary

### 2.1. Current State
LOOKYM is a React Native (Expo) mobile app using Supabase and Cloudinary, aimed at connecting users and businesses via short-form video. Core features (auth, video system, basic chat, profiles) are partially to mostly implemented. Extensive "living documentation" is a key characteristic.

### 2.2. Strengths
*   **Clear Vision:** Well-defined concept.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Significant asset for onboarding and collaboration.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Solid foundation (React Native/Expo, Supabase, Cloudinary).
*   **Good Project Structure & Testing Emphasis:** Logical organization and intent for good testing practices.

### 2.3. Key Weaknesses & Areas for Immediate Attention
*   **Inconsistent Information (Critical):** Contradictory status of the Chat system's Supabase integration (mock data vs. live). This requires immediate verification and unification.
*   **Critical Bugs:** The `react-native-url-polyfill` bundling error is frequently cited as high-priority.
*   **Partially Implemented Core Features:** Google Auth needs completion. Full real-time capabilities for chat/notifications seem pending.
*   **Potential Technical Debt:** Video performance optimization is a recurring theme.

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1. Product Management
*   **Sharpen Value Proposition:** Refine and centrally display a concise value proposition.
*   **User-Story Driven Roadmap:** Reframe backlog items as user stories; use a consistent prioritization framework (e.g., Impact/Effort). Focus on completing core user journeys.
*   **Define Specific KPIs:** Establish clear, measurable KPIs for engagement, onboarding, and feature usage.
*   **Explore Monetization (Long-Term):** Brainstorm potential monetization avenues.
*   **Conduct Competitive Analysis:** Identify USPs and potential feature gaps.

### 3.2. UI/UX
*   **Visual User Flow Diagrams:** Create diagrams for key user journeys to identify pain points.
*   **Information Architecture Review:** Ensure intuitive navigation and information hierarchy.
*   **Enhance Video Experience:** Explore more interactive elements and video creation aids for businesses.
*   **Formal Accessibility Audit:** Conduct an audit against WCAG mobile guidelines.
*   **Standardize Feedback & Error Handling:** Create consistent patterns for loading, success, error, and empty states.
*   **Refine Profile Distinction:** Ensure clear visual/functional differences between user and business profiles.
*   **Improve Onboarding:** Make onboarding more engaging and guide users to key first actions.

### 3.3. Development
*   **Resolve Critical Bugs:** Immediately fix the `react-native-url-polyfill` error.
*   **Address Technical Debt:**
    *   **Unify Chat Backend:** Verify and ensure chat system consistently uses Supabase.
    *   **Consolidate Chat Navigation:** Ensure clean and efficient chat routing.
    *   **Pursue Component Reusability:** Actively refactor for DRY principles.
*   **State Management Review (Zustand):** Check store granularity, data normalization, selector optimization, and persistence choices.
*   **Enhance Testing:** Increase unit/integration test coverage. Consider E2E tests for core journeys.
*   **Prioritize Performance:** Optimize video delivery (compression, ABS, caching) and app bundle size. Profile for bottlenecks.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update dependencies.
*   **Refine Dev Workflow:** Enforce linters/formatters; consider stricter TypeScript options.
